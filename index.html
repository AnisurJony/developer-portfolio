            <h3>Become a Computer scientist</h3>
            <p>
                I want to become a computer scientist. I am a computer science student who passionately love
                programming. Web Development is not primary goa, it is a small milstone which come in the way of my road
                to pragrammer. I saw it as practice work that can speed up my coding. I have a previous work experience
                with graphic design which is related to web design. but i love the work that i am doing.
